In the subject System Integration and Architecture, I expect to learn how different systems and technologies work together. I want to understand how to connect them in a way that makes everything easier and more organized. This will help me build a strong foundation in creating and managing systems in the IT field.
I also hope to learn how to design systems that are smooth and efficient. I believe this subject will give me ideas on how to solve common problems that happen when systems do not match or connect well. Learning this will prepare me to create solutions that are practical and useful.
Lastly, I expect this subject to improve my problem-solving skills and critical thinking. I know that in the real world, IT professionals face challenges when combining different technologies.
